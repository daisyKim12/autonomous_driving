# autonomous_driving
Creating a self-driving car by connecting a JETSON Nano board with a child-friendly car. I am designing and modifying artificial intelligence algorithms to implement autonomous driving for the car. I am also incorporating image recognition using YOLO, to stop the car on stop sign.
